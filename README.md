# CityBreaks

Training excercise - this will not be published as a live website - I am not offering a travel service - but will demonstrate the stages used to develop a fully interactive website using Razor pages in ASP.NET Core.

It is worth noting that any passwords used for logging in to a site or storing user details when the site is created using ASP.net core Razor pages are hashed and salted to prevent passwords being stored in plain text
or encrypted passwords being decoded.
